# Fantasy Name Generator
A web-based random name generator for fantasy settings like DnD created by Ky Nguyen and Gaia Noseworthy!

### Notice
Currently, the front-end and server are completed, but I am still trying to find a way to let users host their own database (MariaDB) much more easily. However, all MariaDB code are listed within *SQL Information* folder should you wish to recreate the database. And should you do so, be sure to modify *settings.py* to fit your settings!

### Instructions
Requires Linux OS but can be run through WSL through Windows OS via the command: `python3 app.py`

### Credits
We would like to extend our special thanks to all the creators and contributors of the *NES-style CSS Framework* for their wonderful work that we could use for our project!
